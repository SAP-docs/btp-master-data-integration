# Schema Validation

Data exchange with the SAP Master Data Integration service is based on the integration models of the SAP One Domain Model. For more information, see [Integration Models](../about-this-service/integration-models-8882bf9.md).

SAP Master Data Integration performs schema validation to ensure that all data adheres to those integration models. SAP Master Data Integration does not check referential integrity. That means that it does not check whether references within master data records are pointing only to existing master data records or code list entries.
