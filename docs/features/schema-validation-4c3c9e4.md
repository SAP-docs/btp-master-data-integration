# Schema Validation

Data exchange with SAP Master Data Integration service is based on the integration models of the SAP One Domain Model. For more information, see [Integration Models](../about-this-service/integration-models-8882bf9.md) .

Master Data Integration service performs schema validation to ensure all data adheres to those integration models. Master Data Integration does not check referential integrity. That is, it does not check whether references within master data records are pointing only to existing master data records or code list entries.
