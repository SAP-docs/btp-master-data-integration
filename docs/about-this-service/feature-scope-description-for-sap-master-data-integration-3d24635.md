The order form also incorporates several other documents that relate to the SLA.

-   The **SAP Business Technology Platform Supplement** overrides the Service Level Agreement for SAP Cloud Services in case of deviations and specifies the SLA for SAP Business Technology Platform in general.

-   The **SAP Business Technology Platform Service Description Guide** provides information on the `<service short-name>` service, including any deviations to the SLA.
