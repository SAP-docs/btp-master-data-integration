# What Is Master Data Integration?

Multi-tenant cloud service in the Intelligent Enterprise. 

SAP Master Data Integration service is a central master data hub. Applications integrate with SAP Master Data Integration to synchronize their local master data databases with the master data database of the central hub. In a typical setup, there is exactly one tenant of SAP Master Data Integration for each landscape. Application tenants of the same landscape integrate against the same tenant. The tenant helps to ensure that all applications within this landscape arrive at a consistent view on master data. The following figure illustrates the situation:

SAP Master Data Integration focuses exclusively on the integration aspect regarding master data. This is achieved via replicating master data records. SAP Master Data Integration enables applications to do initial loads of master data, and afterwards stay in sync with the master data database of SAP Master Data Integration. Administrators can control which data is to be synced with which applications, monitor the replication, and comply with data protection and privacy regulations.
