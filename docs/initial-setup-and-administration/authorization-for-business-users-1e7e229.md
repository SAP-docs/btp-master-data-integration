You can configure authorizations using roles. See [User Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/btp-security#user-model) for more information on the user model in SAP Business Technology Platform.

1.  Make sure you have added `BusinessConfigurationAdmin` role to your user.

    You can assign users to a role collection by adding them to the role collection. Follow the configuration steps in [Assign Users to Role Collections](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_AUTHORIZ_TRUST_MNG/ae8e8427ecdf407790d96dad93b5f723/c5766765bda74ad59fe656977c8fa4d6.html?version=Cloud) .
