# Connecting Applications via Subscriptions

An SAP BTP application can utilize the SAP BTP tenant subscription mechanism to automatically create a tenant of a service and connect to it. While this is also technically possible for applications to consume SAP Master Data Integration service via this subscription mechanism, it has severe drawbacks regarding flexibility, configurability, and security.

For the above reasons, SAP Master Data Integration service must not be consumed via this subscription mechanism.
