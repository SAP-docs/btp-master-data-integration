# Integrating with SAP ECC and non-SAP Applications

In case an out-of-the-boxis [integration](integration-a504461.md) not available, SAP Integration Suite can be utilized for further integration scenarios.

SAP Integration Suite offers a wide range of features to implement integrations, including a special support for integrating with SAP Master Data Integration service. This enables not only SAP ECC but also non-SAP integrations, to communicate with SAP Master Data Integration service via SAP Cloud Integration. The integration is based on the SAP Master Data Integration Adapter for master data synchronization. It allows to map application specific models to SAP One Domain Model integration models.
