# Integrating with SAP ECC and non-SAP Applications

In case an out-of-the-box [integration](integration-a504461.md) is not available, SAP Integration Suite can be used for further integration scenarios.

SAP Integration Suite offers a wide range of features to implement integrations, including a special support for integrating with SAP Master Data Integration service. This enables not only SAP ECC but also non-SAP integrations to communicate with SAP Master Data Integration service via SAP Cloud Integration. The integration is based on the SAP Master Data Integration Adapter for master data synchronization. It allows mapping application-specific models to SAP One Domain Model integration models.

To learn more about synchronizing master data from SAP applications like SAP ECC and non-SAP applications with SAP Master Data Integration service, refer to [SAP Integration Suite - Integration with SAP Master Data Integration blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/05/20/sap-integration-suite-integration-with-sap-master-data-integration-mdi-service/) and [SAP Master Data Integration Receiver Adapter help pages](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATION_SUITE/51ab953548be4459bfe8539ecaeee98d/e91e373bbb5b49ccbc2977152def61a2.html) .

Furthermore, in SAP Discovery Center, there is a mission called " [Use SAP Integration Suite to Synchronize Master Data](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/4248/4505/) ". It includes the use case to synchronize master data between an ECC System, SAP Integration Suite, SAP Master Data Integration service and SAP SuccessFactors on the example of a cost center object.
