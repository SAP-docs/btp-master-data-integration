# Integrating with SAP Master Data Governance \(MDG\)

SAP Master Data Integration service core functionality is to provide replication capabilities for applications that connect to the central master data database. However, SAP Master Data Integration is also supporting advanced master data processes with SAP Master Data Governance \(MDG\) on top.

Master Data Management capabilities with SAP Master Data Governance are for example:

-   **Consolidation** Consolidating master data into a single view for accurate analytics and operational insight \(continuously or on request, such as for initial load or mergers and acquisitions\).

-   **Central Governance** Creating master data in line with business processes \(such as integrated product development or supplier management\).

-   **Data Quality Management** Managing master data quality by defining, enforcing, monitoring, and improving quality.


> ### Note:  
> The support for SAP Master Data Governance use cases with integration to SAP Master Data Integration is currently limited to a pure replication scenario from SAP Master Data Governance to SAP Master Data Integration Service.

Refer to [SAP Master Data Governance \(MDG\)](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/master-data-governance.html) for more information.
