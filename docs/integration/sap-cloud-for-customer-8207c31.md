# SAP Cloud for Customer

Refer to [SAP Cloud for Customer documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CLOUD_FOR_CUSTOMER/f7cae081face472dacb159c51be473e7/6dc7a90e297a419e8ce47f2bb8a6b93c.html) to learn more about the configurations required to replicate business partner master data using the SAP Master Data Integration service.

The types of master data that can be replicated between SAP Cloud for Customer and SAP Master Data Integration include, for example, the following:

## Determination and Business Configuration

Business Partner determination logic for customer master is required in SAP Master Data Integration service to address the following scenario gap:

In SAP S/4HANA, reflexive partner functions can be mandatory in the sales area part of the Business Partner: Customer.

However, SAP Cloud for Customer does not support reflexive partner functions. These functions are implicitly assigned to every business partner with sales area data.

Reflexive partner functions, these are, partner functions for which business partner can be assigned to itself are listed below:

Thus, when a business partner is replicated from SAP Cloud for Customer to SAP S/4HANA, below error can occur:

`Mandatory partner function xx is missing for sales area` .

In order to address this gap, Master Data Integration provides a feature to upload of partner determination logic.

This feature allows you to upload configurations at one go. You need to download configuration data from the back-office system, fill the template, and upload using the REST endpoint in the excel format.

Partner determination configurations need to be downloaded from the back-office system and uploaded to SAP Master Data Integration - Business Partners to validate incoming master data via SOAP channel.

In the back-office system, you should define the rules according to which automatic partner determination is to be carried out. According to the rules defined, the partners are adopted from the customer master records of the sold-to parties to the sales and distribution documents.

-   Sold to party

-   Ship to Party

-   Bill to party

-   Payer
